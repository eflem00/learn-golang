# Learning Go

Some scrath work while learning go

## Motivation

I think I need a bit of a break from dynamically typed scripting langauges. I've enjoyed playing with go quite a bit and it appears to fit well as a tool in the world of distributed systems programming that I appear to be in the thick of right now. It offers a great api for concurrent programming and decent static typing without being object oriented. Plus it has a great mascot :)
